This is the 0.2 (pre-)release of [sbtosgi](https://github.com/typesafehub/sbtosgi), an [sbt](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/) plugin for creating [OSGi](http://www.osgi.org) bundles.

These are the most important changes between sbteclipse 2.1.0 and 2.0.x:

* [Issue #1](https://github.com/typesafehub/sbtosgi/issues/1): Support for passing arbitrary additional headers to BND

sbtosgi is inspired by [bnd4sbt](https://github.com/weiglewilczek/bnd4sbt) and makes use of the awesome [bnd library](http://www.aqute.biz/Bnd/Bnd). sbtosgi requires sbt 0.11.3.

For installation and usage instructinos, please refer to the [sbtosgi README](https://github.com/typesafehub/sbtosgi).
